**Import Words From Reverso***

**Description***

This is an add-on for [Anki][2] - powerful, intelligent flashcards, that makes
remembering things easy via space repetition.

The add-on downloads your dictionary words from [Reverso][3] - a great
free online resource to translate words- and transforms them into Anki cards. 
What makes Reverso very usefull is the Browser plugin that makes it absolutey
no-cost to check the translation of a word. All the words you lookup while
browsing the internet end up in your history in your reverso page and you can
flag them with a star if you really want to remember them.

This plugin lets you import your words into anki.

  cards added to the deck**
* in the card you can click in a link to show the context
